That's my homepage!

I tried to keep it simple and use only HTML, Vanilla JS and CSS, plus a great CSS Framework called [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) by CJ Patoilo.

I put this together very quickly so if there's anything I could do better, please let me know on the issues or on my twitter [@nathannmorais](twitter.com/nathannmorais)!
